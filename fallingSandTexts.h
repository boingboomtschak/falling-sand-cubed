		"FSC is a game based upon the falling sand/powder style games of the late 2000s. \
As with most falling sand games, it involves a particle simulation where each \
particle is of a specific type of element, and the interactions between these elements \
creates some interesting emergent behavior. This iteration of the falling sand game \
involves some major features including 3-dimensional voxels, fast simulation computation \
with OpenGL compute shaders, and a heavy focus on user interaction and customizability.\n\n\
This game was created as a final project for the Graphics class at Seattle University in the fall \
of 2021 by Devon McKee and Michael Pablo.";
